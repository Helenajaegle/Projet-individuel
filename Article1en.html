        <h3>The condition of a women in Egypt ?</h3>
        <p>First to understand the context, the status of women in Egypt isn’t easy. Which is the case for many
            countries in the Middle-East. In a country mostly Muslim we recognize easily the stereotypes we all know.
            Such as women must stay at home, take care of the children and clean while men work. Injustices between men
            and women are very pronounced <a href="https://www.cairn.info/revue-tumultes-2012-1-page-299.htm">(to know more about the condition of women in Egypt ).</a></p>

        <p>In general, in the country less women study, but they succeed very well. The rate of women in the working
            space is very low, 24%. Nawal el Saadawi was a writer and a psychiatrist. She was born on 27 October 1931 in
            Kafr Tahlah in Egypt and died in Cairo in Egypt. She has studied medicine.
        </p>
        <h3>Who was Nawal el Saadawi ?</h3>
        <p>Nawal el Saadawi left school with her degree at the university of Cairo in 1955. She will work for 14 years,
            as manager general in education at the Ministry of Health. She was known for her strong personality; she
            wasn’t scared to confront people that don’t agree with her. For example, the president Anouar el Sadate.
            Indeed, she was imprisoned for her refusal to submit laws of this president.
            She will be released during the arrival of the new president. After this event she will create an
            association for mutual help between women. Unfortunately, it will not last for a long time and she will be
            banished in 1991. The most difficult trial, she had to deal with, is to fight in a country highly
            conservative.</p>
        <h3>Her work considered scandalous,</h3>
        <p>She had published her first book called “Women and sex” in 1969. This work was considered as an insult of the
            values of the country.
            Due to taboo subjects such as sex and religion. Sensible subjects, which are very few talked about publicly
            in this country. Nonetheless, it was the triggering event of feminism in Egypt. After the publication of
            this book, she got fired from her job at the minister of Health. So, after that, she will work completely as
            a writer. She has been involved in many fights, including the obligation of wearing hijab, the imposition of
            men over women. Her strong beliefs, made her qualified as “enemy of Islam”. Not happy about what she fights
            for, she has been receiving threats from men of her country.

        <p>They want to send her to exile. In 1996 she continued her outrage against Egyptian policies. In 2007, she
            will even publish a play called “God resigns from the summit meeting”. The book that will be released of
            this play will directly be banned from the sales. Nonetheless, she will not be quiet, helped by many women
            who are going to join her. In 2008 Nawal el Saadawi won her case, she avoided exile. However, she will stay
            during her life in the U.S. From there, she has continued to support Egyptian women. </p>
