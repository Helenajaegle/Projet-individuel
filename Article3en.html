              <p> Women were always passed over, in a world where we don’t speak about them, about their victories.   </p>
              <h3>Who is Michelle Perrot?</h3>
              <p>For this last article, we will expand the circle beyond Egypt and go to France. Michelle Perrot is a woman with many skills, indeed she is a professor, historian, writer and feminist activist. She was born in 1928 in Paris. She undertakes multiple researches towards the cause of feminism. Considered as an important personality for the support of the women's cause. During 1968 she attended demonstrations and meetings. Later, she even created a women's association.</p>

              <p> In which they will talk about taboo subjects such as abortion, rape or homosexuality. For example, in 1970, Michelle Perrot organized a lesson on women's history. Something that never existed, and yes only men's history was important before. She didn't just speak out for women. She also spoke out for the working class and on xenophobia. In an interview she talked about the fact that when we talk about the power of a woman it is pejorative, while on the contrary the power of a man is meliorative.</p>
              <h3>Her work? </h3>
              <p>In this article, we are going to analyze one of her works, one of her books more precisely. It is a book which includes several articles. It questions the creation of domination and the crushing of women towards men. The fact that nowadays women speak and are not silent anymore. In opposition to all those years when women were silent.</p>
              <p>There is little or no mention of the bravery of women during wars or technical bravery of women. Indeed, historians do not address, do not consider it important to express themselves about women. The subject of women is addressed in two ways. Firstly, they are ignored, they are exposed by their achievements, they are not talked about. Or on the other hand, when they are talked about, they are also misperceived and should be silenced. There is a real silence of these achievements in the images, in the history or in the books. Because in the background of all these male exploits, women have operated. </p>
              <p>They suffer more than what is said in order to improve the freedoms that are given to them with great difficulty. Through this book, Michelle Perrot clearly presents those for whom she fought for.</p>

                The hidden actions of women and the discriminations that take place between the 19th century and the 20th century are presented in this book. Through her life and in her book, Michelle Perrot was able to see the evolution of women's conditioning. At the beginning they walked on. They are not taken seriously because nobody talks about them.</p>
